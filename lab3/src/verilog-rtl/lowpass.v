/** Lowpass FIR filter
    The FIR (Finite Impulse Response) digital filter calculates the discrete convolution between
    the input signal x_k and the filter impulse response â„Ž

                    yk = Sum(x_(k-1)-hi)

    FIR Filter algoritm

    Mcoef[0:M-1] is the coefficient memory holding the filter coefficients
    Mxin[0:M-1] is the memory holding the xk-i input samples
    Repeat forever:
        Wait for DIN_RDY == 1, this means a new sample xk has arrived
        Set Yk to 0
        Store xk to memory Mxin and delete the oldest input sample
        for i=0 to M-1
        Read hi from Mcoef memory and read xk-i from Mxin memory
        Calculate Yk + hi * xk-i and store the result to Yk
